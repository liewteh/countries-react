# Challenge: "Frontend Mentor's REST Countries API with color theme switcher (React)"

This excellent challenge was created by, and lives at [frontendmentor.io](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/rest-countries-api-with-color-theme-switcher-5cacc469fec04111f7b848ca).

In *this* document we will simply break down that challenge into approachable levels, and give extra tips for getting started.

## Challenge Overview

Your *eventual* challenge is to make a React app integrate with the REST Countries API to fetch country data and display it like in the designs provided by [frontendmentor.io](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/rest-countries-api-with-color-theme-switcher-5cacc469fec04111f7b848ca).

However, in the earlier levels you will be given a file containing with the downloaded countries data, so that you do not have to fetch it from the API.

## Pre-requisites - what do I need to know to finish this challenge?

Level 1 - React week 1:

- React `props`
- The `array.map` method and its use in React JSX
- Lots of CSS (flexbox recommended)

Later levels - React week 2:

- Event handlers: `onClick` for buttons
- Event handlers: `onChange` for input fields and `select` elements
- `useState`: The React State hook 
- `useEffect`: The React Effect hook, and how to use it with `fetch`.

## Getting Started

* **Don't** clone this repo.
* Read Level 1 below, but don't start
* Carefully read [the brief in the frontend mentor challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/rest-countries-api-with-color-theme-switcher-5cacc469fec04111f7b848ca)
* Sign in to frontendmentor.io and download and expand the starter pack
* Read the instructions and guidance in that pack.
* Read Level 1 below, again!  It tells you what you can ignore!
* Make your own React app using `create-react-app`.  See [(this guide)](https://docs.codeyourfuture.io/students/guides/creating-a-react-app) if you have forgotten how.
* Copy the [./countriesAll.json](./countriesAll.json) data file into your `src/` directory, and then import it.
* Put your project on GitHub (see below)
* Host it on Netlify (see below)
* Write a plain HTML prototype (e.g. on codepen) with some copy-pasted country "cards".  THEN, once you are confident about the HTML you need to create...
* Start to code the React app!

### The data:

* The data you will need is available in the file [./countriesAll.json](./countriesAll.json).  This is a list of all countries, obtained from `https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/all`
* Read "Getting Started" for what to do with this file.
* In *later* levels you will make your app fetch the data directly from the API as described in the frontendmentor challenge.

## GitHub & Hosting:

Add your project in github and host it on Netlify.


| site:         | correct name                                    |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| GitHub repo   | `countries-react`                               |
| Netlify site  | `cyf-YOURGITHUBUSERNAME-countries-react`        |



# Level 1 Challenge

* Write a react app to present the list of countries as shown in the frontend mentor challenge.
* Get as close as possible to the presentation.
* Format the population correctly
* Ignore the search box
* Ignore the region select
* Ignore the colour theme selector
* Ignore the requirement to allow "clicking into" specific countries.  Just show the main list.
* Publish your project on GitHub and Netlify with the correct names (see Hosting, above).

# Level 2 challenge

* Add the search box
* When the search box has text in it, your app should update the displayed list of countries to only show matches
  * Accept matches of the string in the country name **AND** matches in the capital's name
* Matches should be case-insensitive.
* When the search bar is clear, all countries should be shown.

# Level 3 challenge

* Add the "region select" menu
* When this is changed, only show the countries which:
    * have the chosen region, AND
    * match the search box term (if there is one)
* When a region is not selected (i.e. the menu is set to "Filter by region") then countries should NOT be filtered by region and only the search rules should apply.

# Level 4 challenge

* Allow users to click on a country and view that country's full details, as shown in the frontendmentor challenge.
* Make sure to allow clicking on bordering countries to visit these neighbours
* Don't forget the "back" button

# Level 5 challenge
* Implement the colour scheme picker

# Beyond - ideas for more work

- easy: Add a "random country" button
- Advanced: Make a quiz where a country card is shown and 5 random capitals - the user must correctly guess the correct capital.
    - use a separate component to develop this without affecting your main app
- Advanced: Make a game where two countries are named and the user tries to navigate from one country to another via their bordering countries in the fewest possible steps.    
- record "favourite" countries
   - Find a way to persist these even after the browser tab is closed
- See the existing [CYF Group project: Countries](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/group-project-countries) for more ideas
